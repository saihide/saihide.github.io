### 背景
公司做内容搜索的结果，不太理想，文件长短对得分的影响偏大，tf和idf相同时，并不需要文章短的排在前面。

elasticsearch从5.0开始，默认的[similarity algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)是[Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)，如果想知道elasticsearch为什么改用BM25的理论上的理由，可以看[BM25 Demystified](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2016/sf/improved-text-scoring-with-bm25)。

### 前提


1. 讨论给文本文档打分的情况，不讨论timestamp/boolean/metrics/numeric/vector这些类型的打分情况。
2. 当elasticsearch的索引有多个shard时，shards对打分有影响，先考虑索引只有一个shard的情况。

### tf–idf
tf(t,d): term frequency: the number of times a term t occurs in a document d.

idf:inverse document frequency: an inverse function of the number of documents in which it occurs： diminishes(减少) the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely


### The BM25 Algorithm

![](https://saihide.github.io/image/bm25_equation.png)

1. qi is the 第i个 query term.
如果搜"shane"，就只有一个查询词，q0="shane"。如果搜"shane connelly",就有两个查询词，q0="shane",q1="connelly"
2. IDF(qi) is the inverse document frequency of the 第i个 query term.
The IDF component of our formula measures how often a term occurs in all of the documents and “penalizes(惩罚)” terms that are common. The actual formula Lucene/BM25 uses for this part is:
![](https://saihide.github.io/image/idf_equation.png)


	-  docCount： the total number of documents that have a value for the field in the shard (across shards, if you’re using search_type=dfs_query_then_fetch)

	- f(qi): the number of documents which contain the ith query term
	- function graph
	![](https://saihide.github.io/image/idf_graph.png)

	We can see here that queries containing rarer terms have a higher multiplier,so they contribute more to the final score.his makes intuitive sense: the term “the” is likely to occur in nearly every English document, so when a user searches for something like “the elephant,” “elephant” is probably more important — and we want it to contribute more to the score — than the term “the” (which will be in nearly all documents).
3. fieldLen/avgFieldLen: the length of the field is divided by the average field length
We can think of this as how long a document is relative to the average document length. If a document is longer than average, the denominator gets bigger (decreasing the score) and if it’s shorter than average, the denominator gets smaller (increasing the score).Note that the implementation of field length in Elasticsearch is based on number of terms (vs something else like character length). T**he way to think about this is that the more terms in the document — at least ones not matching the query — the lower the score for the document.** Again, this makes intuitive sense: if a document is 300 pages long and mentions my name once, it’s less likely to have as much to do with me as a short tweet which mentions me once.
4. b:  shows up in the denominator(分母) and that it’s multiplied by the ratio of the field length we just discussed. **If b is bigger, the effects of the length of the document compared to the average length are more amplified(放大).**To see this, you can imagine if you set b to 0, the effect of the length ratio would be completely nullified and the length of the document would have no bearing(没有影响) on the score.  By default, b has a value of 0.75 in Elasticsearch.
5. f(qi,D): how many times does the 第i个 query term occur in document D(TF).
